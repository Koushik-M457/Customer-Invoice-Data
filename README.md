# Customer-Invoice-Data
This project focuses on applying unsupervised machine learning techniques to analyze and segment customers based on their invoice data. By using KMeans and DBSCAN clustering algorithms, we aim to identify different customer groups based on their purchasing behavior.

Features
  Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing invoice data for analysis.
  Feature Engineering: Extracting meaningful features for clustering.
  KMeans Clustering: Segmenting customers into clusters.
  DBSCAN Clustering: Identifying customer clusters with density-based clustering.
  Visualization: Graphical representation of customer segments.

Technologies Used
  Python
  Pandas
  NumPy
  Scikit-learn
  Matplotlib
  Seaborn

Installation:

 1.Clone the repository:
         git clone https://github.com/Koushik-M457/Clustering-Customer-Invoice-Data.git

 2.Navigate to the project directory:
        cd Clustering-Customer-Invoice-Data

 3.Install required dependencies:
        pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage:
  1.Open the Jupyter Notebook:
          jupyter notebook Project_on_clustering_customer_invoice_data.ipynb
  2.Run the cells step by step to execute the clustering process.

Results:
    1. Visual representation of customer clusters.
    2. Insights into customer purchasing patterns.
